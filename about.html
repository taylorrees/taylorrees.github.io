        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          A self-motivated, driven individual with experience working in the catering and recruitment sectors. With a passion for design, code and technology startups I love gaining access to the latest and greatest tools that aim to disrupt an industry. However I also understand that, in our modern, fast paced lives, a sense of community is more important than ever (read my thoughts on this here <a href="https://medium.com/@tjmrees" target="_blank">medium.com/@tjmrees</a>).

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>
          My strongest interests lie with the intersection of design and code. I indulge in the feeling of taking an idea from its earliest conception to a working implementation. I especially enjoy designing and creating mobile first web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I feel that my desire to create and discover comes from my childhood experiences of living on a farm. Growing up with the farm yard at my doorstep opened me up to a world of creativity when I was younger, and this creativity has now been allowed to shine through in new ways through the medium of code.
        </p>

        <p>
          An example of how my childhood inspired me would be one of my personal projects (<a href="http://cattletrack.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">cattletrack.herokuapp.com</a>) which is essentially a herd management system. I was frustrated by the inefficiency and lack of data being kept on the majority of modern cattle farms in my area, so I decided to create a small web application to try and solve this.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also adore cooking. Cooking is something that I have enjoyed from a young age and is something that I still enjoy today.

        <p>
          Throughout my career, both academic and professional, I have developed a varied set of transferable skills; as well as developing skills outside of what has been required.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love writing small applications that solve a specific problem. I have experience of working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Python and Git, as well as a basic knowledge of Ruby. I particularly love using JavaScript to develop beautiful experiences, on both the server and client side using the latest and greatest JavaScript frameworks.
        </p>

        <p>
          I admire well written code and I could spend hours reading, learning and understanding how a solution has been implemented. Once I have found the ideal solution to a problem, I enjoy using new, emerging tools and sharing my knowledge with others.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a passion for design, which has led me to develop a wide set of photoshop and illustrator skills. Alongside these design tools, I also looked into the use of After Effects and Premiere Pro when creating how-to videos for previous projects.
